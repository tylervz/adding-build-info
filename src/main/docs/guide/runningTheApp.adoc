When you visit http://localhost:8080, you will notice that all the properites
shown on the `grails-app/views/index.gsp` page are blank.

And when you visit http://localhost:8080/metadata, you will notice that much of the JSON data returned is `null`.

This is because those properties only get set when the application is built into a runnable
`.war` file or `.jar` file and then deployed.

Run the `./gradlew assemble` command to generate two `.war` files and a `.jar` file in the `./build/libs` directory.
One will be named something like `adding-build-info-0.1.war` and the other `adding-build-info-0.1-plain.war`.
The `-plain.war` is NOT a standalone runnable war file; it is used for Servlet container deployment, such as Tomcat.

Once you deploy one of those files, you will be able to see the additional build informtion that is now being stored in `grails.build.info`.
