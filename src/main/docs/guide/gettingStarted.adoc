In this guide we are going to add properties to the ``grails.build.info`` file
and then retrieve that build environment information via the running application.

Having access to this information about the build environment will give you an easy way
to identify when the build artifact was generated, how the build artifact was generated,
and the Git commit info will tell you what specific code is running.

Note: this guide was adapted from a https://grails.org/blog/2017-04-02.html[blog post] written by SÃ¸ren Berg Glasius and Colin Harrington.
