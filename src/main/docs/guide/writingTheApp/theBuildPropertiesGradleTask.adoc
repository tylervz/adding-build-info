When you build/run your Grails applications, one of tasks that Gradle always executes is ``buildProperties``.
This task takes a small set of build information from your project and places it in a file, which the Grails ``Metadata`` class later reads.
This file is located in the ``META-INF`` directory and is named ``grails.build.info``.

At build time, you can find this file at ``build/resources/main/META-INF/grails.build.info``. The contents of this file looks like:

.grails.build.info

#Wed, 05 Jun 2024 16:06:24 -0400

info.app.version=0.1
info.app.name=metadata
grails.env=production
info.app.grailsVersion=6.2.0
----

This info primarily comes from ``build.gradle`` and ``gradle.properties``
(the curious can check out the https://github.com/grails/grails-gradle-plugin/blob/c640157b5eaab309577981694c9e282aeab678c8/src/main/groovy/org/grails/gradle/plugin/core/GrailsGradlePlugin.groovy#L221[grails-gradle-plugin source code]).
This file will be part of your final application when you build your ``.jar`` or ``.war`` file.
