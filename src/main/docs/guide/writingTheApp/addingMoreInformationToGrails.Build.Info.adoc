With the Gradle build system, it is possible to hook into the build process and execute our own code.
In this case, we want Gradle to complete writing the ``build/resources/main/META-INF/grails.build.info`` file,
and then we want to add additional properties to the file.

To accomplish this, first, import the following ``java.time`` classes and add the `grgit` Gradle plugin in `build.gradle`.

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
import java.time.ZoneId
import java.time.ZonedDateTime
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter

plugins {
...
    id "org.ajoberstar.grgit" version "5.2.2"
}
----

Next, add the following snippet to ``build.gradle``:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[lines=83..130]
----

<1> set ``build.time`` to the time that the build was executed.
<2> read an environment variable set by your build server (CircleCI in the above example)
